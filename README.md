## Apple Tree
```
    It is a deciduous tree, usually up to 15 meters in height, but cultivated trees are generally only about 3-5 meters high. The trunk is grayish brown and the bark has some degree of shedding. The fruit is generally red, but it depends on the variety. The fruit of the apple tree is rich in minerals and vitamins and is one of the most commonly eaten fruits. The flowering period of apple trees is based on the climate of each region, but it is generally concentrated in April-May. Apples are cross-pollinated plants, and most of the varieties cannot be fruited. After apple cultivation, it usually begins to bear fruit in 2-3 years. The length of fruit growth period is 65-87 days for early mature varieties, 90-133 days for medium-maturing varieties, and 137-168 days for late-maturing varieties.
